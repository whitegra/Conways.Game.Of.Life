Conway’s Game of Life - Python Implementation

This project implements Conway’s Game of Life, a cellular automaton where complex patterns emerge from simple rules. The simulation is visualized using Matplotlib animation, with each live cell assigned a unique color.

Features:
- Animated visualization of Conway’s Game of Life.
- Randomized color mapping for alive cells.
- Toroidal grid (wrapping edges) to simulate an infinite plane.
- Customizable grid size and initial conditions.

Requirments: 
- import numpy as np
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- import matplotlib.animation as animation
